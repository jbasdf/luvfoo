# How to install Luvfoo #

1. Start by making sure your RubyGems are version 1.2.0 or greater:

        sudo gem update --system

2. Add the Github repository to your gems:

        sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

3. Luvfoo runs on Ruby on Rails, so first you need to get Rails running. In order to do that, download Rails from the [Ruby on Rails site] or install though gems:

        sudo gem install rails -v=2.1.1

4. Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and edit it to reflect the database names you would like to use.

5. Copy config/global_config.yml.example to config/global_config.yml and edit it to reflect your application customized configurations.

6. Copy config/initializers/mail.rb.example to config/initializers/mail.rb and edit it to reflect your mail configurations.

7. Copy config/environments/production.rb.example to config/environments/production.rb and edit `asset_host` in order to reflects the name of the production asset server.

8. You will need to install some 3th party softwares. Above, there is the command to install them in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distribuitions:

        sudo apt-get install gettext
        
              or in OSX 10.5
              
        sudo gem install gettext

9. luvfoo currently has a few dependencies that prevent a basic rake from running. We need to install the following:

        sudo gem install mini_magick
        sudo gem install hpricot
        sudo gem install gcnovus-avatar
        sudo gem install ruby-openid
        
    Now you should be able to run rails built in rake tasks to include the rest.
        
        sudo rake gems:install

10. Run the following commands to create the database, the tables and then populate them with default data:

        rake db:create
        rake db:schema:load
        
11. We need to get solr running before you can populate the database:

        mkdir tmp/pids
        mkdir tmp/pids/solr
        rake solr:start

12. Now we can populate the database:

        rake luvfoo:db:populate

13. Start the server with:

        script/server

14. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and login with username `admin` and password `admin`. Change it ASAP.

15. Have fun with *Luvfoo*!
